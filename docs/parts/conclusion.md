# Conclusion

Thank you for participating in the workshop! Let's recap some of the key takeways that we've learned:

- Signed up for an Equinix Metal account and created an API key
- Installed the Equinix Metal CLI
- You prepared a code repository to use for creating and testing your runners.
- You created a new machine on Equinix Metal to use as a runner. We use a smaller machine for this workshop, but you can use any machine size you want, provided it is the right architecture (x64 or arm64) for your code.
- You configured a new runner for your repository.
- You installed the prerequisites for the runner on your Equinix Metal runner machine.
- You downloaded and configured the runner software on your Equinix Metal runner machine.
- We configured our github actions workflow to use a self-hosted runner.
- We ran the workflow on our self-hosted runner.
- We saw the output of the workflow on our self-hosted runner.
- We saw the output of the workflow on github.
